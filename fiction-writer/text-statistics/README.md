# Text Statistics MCP server

## The Idea
Have some control over how text statistics are calculated while analysing manuscripts... with AI

## The Result

MCP is rising in popularity. Why not try it out?

This project provides tools to extract detailed statistics and insights from text, including word and character counts, sentence and paragraph analysis, estimated reading time, and page count calculations for various formats.

## Usage with VS Code

Follow the instructions here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server 

or, if you just want to get started, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. (You can do this by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P and typing Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)) or to your workspace settings (add it to a file called .vscode/mcp.json in your workspace)


NPM

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "fw-text-statistics": {
        "command": "node",
        "args": ["build/index.js"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Docker

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "fw-text-statistics": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "mcp/fw/text-statistics"],
      }
    }
