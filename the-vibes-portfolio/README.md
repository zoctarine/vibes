# The Vibes Profolio

> [!NOTE] 
> Part of the [vibes](https://github.com/vibes) playground.
>
> *"Vibes" are quick experiments, mostly built by AI with prompt guidance. Expect rough edges â€“ it's not production-ready, likely buggy, and definitely not example code, but it works..somehow. Think of it as a snapshot from my AI coding playground.*
