# DocFlattliner - Flattening documentation since 2025

> *"Vibes" are quick experiments, mostly built by AI with prompt guidance. Expect rough edges â€“ it's not production-ready, likely buggy, and definitely not example code, but it works..somehow. Think of it as a snapshot from my AI coding playground.*

## The Idea
Easily convert documentation website to single .md files so we can give them to AI chats

.. should have UI as well... sometime... soon

## The Result
A tool to crawl websites and convert them to markdown documentation.


## AI Tools

- ![GitHub Copilot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Github_Copilot-45%25-blue?style=social)


## Features

- Crawls links within the same domain
- Converts HTML content to Markdown
- Preserves links as local anchors within the document
- Handles page titles as headers
- Supports custom depth for crawling
- Two modes: flat (sections at end) or nested (inline content)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run doc -- <root-url> [max-depth] [output-file] [--mode=nested|flat]
```

### Parameters

- **root-url**: The URL to start crawling from (required)
- **max-depth**: Maximum depth of crawling (default: 2)
- **output-file**: Name of the output file (default: flattened-doc.md)
- **mode**: Either 'nested' or 'flat' (default: flat)
  - **flat**: All content is placed at the end of the document
  - **nested**: Content appears inline where links are found

### Examples

```bash
# Basic usage with defaults (depth 2, flat mode)
npm run doc -- https://example.com
