# Draft Editor

> [!NOTE] 
> Part of the [vibes](https://github.com/vibes) playground.

> *"Vibes" are quick experiments, mostly built by AI with prompt guidance. Expect rough edges â€“ it's not production-ready, likely buggy, and definitely not example code, but it works..somehow. Think of it as a snapshot from my AI coding playground.*

## The Idea
What if... i can make a simple editor with code-mirror for my writing needs


## The Result
A simple text editor with Codemirror, that let's you edit scenes, chapters, reorder and compile them to a complete document. It also has a fullscreen distraction free view.
