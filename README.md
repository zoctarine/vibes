# Vibes

Vibes are a set of small, often strange, sometimes-useful, and frequently confused apps and tools. They all share one thing in common:

    They're made by collaborating with AI — not just as a tool, but as a co-developer.

This is a playground for exploring what it's like to:
- generating ideas with AI
- writing most (or all) of the code through AI guidance
- only stepping in when AI can't solve it or goes in a wrong direction

# What's inside

In the Vibes/ folder, you'll find a random collection of apps:

- [story-o-matic](/story-o-matic): a choose your own adventure style of infinite storytelling app
- [draft-editor](/draft-editor): a draft for a distracton free minimalistic editor for writing novels with mardown (and use codemirror editor)
- [prompt-enhancer](/prompt-enhancer): a small MCP server for enahncing prompts
- fiction-writer/ tools for writing fiction
    - [text-statistics](/fiction-writer/text-statistics): small MCP server to count words, pages, reading times, etc

# Tools

I experiment with (in alphabetical order):

# Why?

Because the future showed up early, and instead of flying cars, it brought ... agents
