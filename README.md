# Vibes

Vibes are a set of small, often strange, sometimes-useful, and frequently confused apps and tools. They all share one thing in common:

`They're made by collaborating with AI â€” not just as a tool, but as a co-developer.`

This is a playground for exploring what it's like to:
- rapidly turn ideas into working prototypes
- writing most (or all?) of the code through AI guidance
- have fun while coding

# What's inside

In the Vibes/ folder, you'll find a random collection of apps:

- [story-o-matic](/story-o-matic/README.md): a choose your own adventure style of infinite storytelling app
- [draft-editor](/draft-editor/README.md): a draft for a distracton free minimalistic editor for writing novels with mardown (and use codemirror editor)
- [doc-flattliner](/doc-flattliner/README.md): crawls a documentation websites and saves it to a single markdown file. Optionally, uses AI to compress/summarize large files.
- [prompt-enhancer](/prompt-enhancer/README.md): a small MCP server for enahancing prompts
- [memory-port](/memory-port/README.md): a simple MCP server that persist a chat summary, so it can be loaded in a different chat client (compatible with Memory Port Vault)
- [memory-port-vault](/memory-port-vault/README.md) A document storage for memory-port (organized per projects)
- fiction-writer/ tools for writing fiction
    - [text-statistics](/fiction-writer/text-statistics/README.md): small MCP server to count words, pages, reading times, etc
- [portfolio](/the-vibes-portfolio/README.md): a simple portfolio site

coming soon:
- vst midi plugin to generate backing track while you play
- codebase summarization and commenting for ai agents. make them use less tokens for complex tasks
- fiction writer: talk with your characters
- fiction writer: automatic Markdown metadata extraction (location, characters,...)

# Why?

Because the future showed up early, and instead of flying cars, it brought ... agents
