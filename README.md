# Vibes

Vibes are a set of small, often strange, sometimes-useful, and frequently confused apps and tools. They all share one thing in common:

    They're made by collaborating with AI ‚Äî not just as a tool, but as a co-developer.

This is a playground for exploring what it's like to:
- generating ideas with AI
- writing most (or all) of the code through AI guidance
- only stepping in when things go off the rails

# What's inside

In the Vibes/ folder, you'll find a ragtag collection of apps:

- story-o-matic: a choose your own adventure style of infinite storytelling app
- draft-editor: a draft for a distracton free minimalistic editor for writing novels with mardown (and use codemirror editor)
- fiction-writer/ tools for writing fiction
    - text-statistics: small MCP server to count words, pages, reading times, etc

Because the future showed up early, and instead of flying cars, it brought ... agents
