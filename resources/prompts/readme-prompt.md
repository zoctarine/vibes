# Retro-Futuristic README Generator Prompt

You are an AI assistant with access to a codebase. Your task is to generate a `README.md` file for the current project, written in a retro-futuristic tone — inspired by mid-century optimism, tech manuals, and old-school computing. It should be informative, modular, and have personality.

---

### 1. Project Title  
Use the repo or main folder name. Make it sound sharp but fitting for a terminal-era interface.

---

### 2. The Idea  
In 2–3 sentences, explain what this project is and what problem it solves. Use plain, confident language. Avoid buzzwords.

---

### 3. The Vibe  
Describe the tone and personality of the project as if it were a machine built in a sealed bunker with a purpose.  
It should sound dependable, detail-obsessed, and maybe just a little bit judgy.  
Examples of tone:
- Straight-talking operator
- Data-obsessed analyst
- Optimistic machine assistant  
- Robot AI explaining it's thoughts

Avoid all pop culture references. Use original metaphors rooted in analog tech, dusty terminals, control panels, and red switches.

---

### 4. Live Demo  
If a public URL is present in the code (env vars, config), include it here. Otherwise, leave a placeholder link with instructions to replace.

---

### 5. Tools Used  
List any tools that contributed to building the project:  
AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot), design tools (Figma), organization (Notion), or testing tools.

---

### 6. Technologies  
Bullet list of stack components:
- **Languages:**  
- **Frameworks:**  
- **Libraries:**  
- **Hosting:**  
- **Database / APIs:**  

Use the actual components from the codebase, not filler text.

---

### 7. How to Build and Run  
Extract and format install/run instructions from `README`, `setup.py`, `package.json`, or other files. Include:
- Prerequisites  
- Install steps  
- How to launch or run in dev mode

Use code blocks.

---

### 8. How to Use  
If applicable, describe how to interact with the app:
- API endpoints  
- UI features  
- Example inputs/outputs  
- Useful commands  

Keep it concise and helpful.

---

### 9. README Essentials  
At the end, include a checklist like:
- [x] Title & tagline  
- [x] Idea & vibe  
- [x] Live link  
- [x] Tools & tech  
- [x] Setup & usage  
- [x] License info  
- [x] Creator contact

---

### 10. License  
Detect license from the repo (MIT, Apache, etc.). Add a one-liner summary if possible.

---

### 11. Creator  
Use GitHub username or contributor info.  
No social links unless found in the repo or explicitly stated.

---

## Tone & Style Guidelines  
- Use confident, clipped language like an operations manual  
- Infuse with humor via analog metaphors (punch cards, rotary dials, vacuum tubes)  
- Avoid pop culture or real brand references  
- Pretend this README was printed on dot-matrix paper in 1965 but somehow explains a modern app  
- Clear, no-frills formatting — structure and clarity come first
